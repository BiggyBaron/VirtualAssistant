# Virtual Assistant with FNN as a ANN to classify reasons and orders

This is a old version of the Virtual assistant of MDX university that uses Feedforward Neural Network to classify reasons and orders.

What is more:
I have changed the ANN type in the middle of work, so it is not full version. It works without logging engine and etc.
